Imagine you want to contribute to another project you've found on GitHub. You want to bring this remote repository down to your local computer so you can start using it. You also want to explore the repository and understand how it works so you can make a meaningful contribution.

## What is cloning?

When you clone a repository from GitHub, a copy of that repository is downloaded to your machine. If you clone via the Git CLI, you have to enter your GitHub credentials. You also have to set the local repository's remote URL. The remote URL is required so Git knows where to push your changes.

## Clone from Visual Studio Code

You can clone a repository from GitHub using the Visual Studio Code Explorer or the command palette. If you have a new window with no folder open, you can toggle the Explorer from the activity bar or by selecting **View** > **Explorer**. You'll see a **Clone Repository** button.

If you have a folder open in Visual Studio Code, you won't see the **Clone Repository** button, but you can still clone a repository from the command palette by entering **Git: Clone**.

When you select **Git: Clone**, you see an option to enter the URL of a repository or select **Clone from GitHub**. You see a list of repositories you've created on GitHub.com. You can even search for other repositories across GitHub.com from here.

When you choose the repository you want to clone, Visual Studio Code will clone it over HTTPS. After it's done, Visual Studio Code will prompt you to open the folder. Visual Studio Code sets up the remote URL, so you don't have to worry about configuring anything.

## I cloned a repository. Now what?

When you want to contribute to a project, you'll often start with browsing the files to understand what's happening and the history of the project. To help you easily see project history, Visual Studio Code provides a Timeline view that shows all the previous commits made to each file. This is helpful when you want to gain context of the repository, see who contributed to it, and understand how old or recent the changes to the project are.

Visual Studio Code opens a *diff* editor when you select commits in the Timeline view. The diff editor is a convenient way to compare changes between the current version and the specific commit and understand a file's history. By viewing the commits in the Timeline view, you can quickly get an idea of the parts of the project that need to be updated or maintained.
