GitHub Actions allows you to customize your workflows to meet your unique needs. You can configure a GitHub Actions workflow to be triggered when an event occurs in your repository, such as an issue being created or a pull request being opened.

Imagine your team wants to automate processes like build and test pull requests, deploy your application every time a release is created, and label issues every time one is opened. Github Actions workflows allow you to do all of these things and more! 

In this module, you'll be introduced to GitHub Actions workflows.
