Imagine that you're a developer with administrator permissions for a GitHub repository. You want to automate security checks. These steps will help you analyze your releases for any vulnerabilities. Luckily, your organization has purchased and enabled GitHub Advanced Security. Your advanced security license enables you to accomplish these tasks using CodeQL. 

CodeQL enables you to analyze the code in your GitHub repository and identify security vulnerabilities. It is available for public repositories and private repositories owned by your organization. CodeQL supports many languages for analysis including: C/C++, Java, Python, among others.

##  Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Create a database by using CodeQL to extract a single relational representation of each source file in the codebase
- Run CodeQL in a database to find problems in your source code and find potential security vulnerabilities
- Understand CodeQL scan results using queries created by GitHub, or your own custom queries

##  Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of GitHub Actions
- Familiarity with GitHub code scanning
- Administrative access to a repository
- Familiarity with SQL, Prolog, and Datalog
