Your goal in this module was to recognize the value of GitHub Packages and when you can use them in your workflow. You used GitHub Actions to build and test your code, and then used a GitHub Actions workflow to publish to GitHub Packages.

You learned about:

- How to set up a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow with GitHub Actions
- How to publish to a Package Repository
- How to authenticate, install, and maintain GitHub Packages
