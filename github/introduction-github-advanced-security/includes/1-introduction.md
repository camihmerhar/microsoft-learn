Imagine that you are a security administrator for an enterprise organization. Your responsibility is to protect your organization from cyber security threats. You know that the constant menace of data breaches makes securing your development environment more important than ever. Bad actors can cause devastating events. However, the negligence of users and administrators can also create serious security incidents. As hackers become more sophisticated, the impact and damage to businesses and people have proven to be far-reaching and occasionally tragic.

A few examples from recent years come to mind:

- **2017:** A vulnerability found on Equifax servers allows hackers to execute malicious code remotely. The event exposes more than 143 million records, including 209,000 credit card numbers. An attack that human error makes possible, breaks customer trust. The Apache Foundation had released a patch to address the vulnerability just two months before the breach. Unfortunately, Equifax delayed applying the necessary system updates.

- **2018:** Hackers successfully breach the Marriott Hotels systems. The breach compromises 500 million users and exposes data records for 327 million guests. This data includes names, travel dates, passport numbers, and home addresses.

- **2021:** The discovery of a vulnerability in the open-source logging software Log4j marks the later part of 2021. Cybersecurity experts label the fallout caused by the bug as the most serious to date due to the popularity of the software. Because of this popularity, hackers seeking to break into digital spaces exploit a massive field of operation, which puts millions of servers at risk. The vulnerability gives these hackers complete control over some of these applications.

These incidents show the importance of having every resource at your disposal to successfully deal with threats.
