This module looks at how your organization can use Github Advanced Security features to improve security. You'll learn what it means to "shift left." Develop an understanding of how shifting left helps secure your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Finally, you'll review different security workflow models to identify best practices.

At the end of this unit, you'll understand how the right tools, combined with organizational culture, increase the security of your environments and codebases. This begins with adopting a security-focused mindset.

## Adopt a security mindset

The more security-centric your organizational culture is, the more everyone remembers to view their actions, work, and decisions through the lens of security. This perspective provides better outcomes for your software development and planning. However, a sound security strategy involves more than simply putting protective tools in place. You also have to account for human error. A user could accidentally enable an attack or a developer could write insecure code. Think about how many attacks begin by tricking or forcing a member of an organization.

## Shift left

You may have heard that a company or development team is beginning to "shift left." To understand this phrase, you must first realize that security has commonly been an isolated topic in many software development paradigms. The development lifecycle has figuratively begun "on the left" with design and development. Then the lifecycle ends to the right, bringing in quality control and deployment tasks. Workflows often include security only after the development stage. At that point, only a specific group would perform a security review.

In the SDLC, shifting left means adopting security practices early. When development shifts left, everyone considers security when they contribute to the code. They integrate security into the design phase, making it easier to write secure code and policies.

### Faulty security models

Developers that view security as an isolated consideration can struggle when quality assurance or security discover errors in the project's code. The development team has to fix the code. At this point, they may have already begun a new project. Passing code back to be repaired results in two open work streams. This is an inefficient use of time and resources. Although some elements of a defective security model may be common, you should still work to avoid them.

This table outlines traits regularly found in faulty organizational security models.

| Facet  | Comment |
|---|---|
| Scope of team involvement |  Only a limited number of team members are responsible for security. The persons building the application aren't the same involved in ensuring security. Security experts are outside of the development workflow. |
| Prioritization | Security reviews and quality control are separate steps at the end of the development stage.|
| Documentation | Security documentation is non-existent. Written standards and guidelines haven't been established to granularly regulate what type of information enters the codebase and by whom. Subsequently, team members lack a common understanding of expectations and directives.|
| Platform configuration | The development environment isn't configured to align with and enforce established security guidelines.|

### The ideal security model

Ideally, everyone is responsible for securing the project within their scope of work. The team that writes the code is the same team performing tests and dealing with the results of those tests in real time. Policies exist for each phase of the operation to ensure code quality. Automation plays a significant role in creating an efficient workflow.

This table shows key elements of the ideal security model:

| Facet  |  Comment |
|---|---|
| Scope of team involvement | Teams shift left. Each role from design to deployment is concerned with security. |
| Prioritization | Throughout all stages of development, measures are in place to protect assets|
| Documentation | Standards and guidelines are in writing. Teams know the process to report bugs.| 
| Tooling | The development platform enforces standards and keeps code and environments secure.

### Security policies

A strong security culture needs documentation to define the persons or roles that can perform specific actions within a repository or branch. In GitHub, these documents are _policies_. Policies may require a code review before merging. They ensure that the code passes certain status checks. For example, you may want to specify who can delete a branch or push code to it. In GitHub, you store policy details in your repository, in the `SECURITY.md` file. This file will also include instructions on reporting any bugs or vulnerabilities found in the project.

#### Enforce policies

GitHub Advanced Security includes compliance and policy management features. You can use policies to stipulate standards and procedures that keep your code healthy. Policies also identify who to contact when an error is found.

Policies alone don't enforce your organization's requirements. Policies are organizational measures. Administrators ensure user adherence by setting up protected branches. The configuration of a branch allows you to force specific requirements. For example, tests such as code scanning must pass before merging changes. Another example is requiring a reviewer to approve a pull request before reviews release it for merging.
