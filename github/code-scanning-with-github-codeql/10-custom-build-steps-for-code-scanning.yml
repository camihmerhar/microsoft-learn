quiz:
  title: Custom build steps for code scanning
  questions:
  - content: "Manual build steps in your workflow file are necessary in which situation?"
    choices:
    - content: "If there are unsupported languages in your repository."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Unsupported languages cannot be used with CodeQL code scanning."
    - content: "If there are supported languages with a non-standard build process."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "If you want to increase the build speed for supported or unsupported languages."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Manual build steps are not designed to increase the speed of a build."
  - content: "Autobuild is currently succeeding for one of the languages in Layla's repository, but failing for another. What should she do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create another workflow file for the language that is failing autobuild."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub only supports one code scanning workflow file for each repository."
    - content: "Add language-specific build commands for the language where autobuild is failing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Disable Autobuild for the entire repository."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It isn't necessary to disable Autobuild for languages where it succeeds. Other options allow you to customize the build process where Autobuild fails."
