  title: How does CodeQL analyze code?
  questions:
  - content: "To create a database, CodeQL extracts:"
    choices:
    - content: "A single relational representation that contains all of the source files in the database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "A single relational representation of each source file in the codebase."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Multiple relational representations for each source file in the database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: "How does CodeQL database creation work for compiled languages?"
    choices:
    - content: "The extractor runs directly on the source code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "For interpreted languages, the extractor runs directly on the source code."
    - content: "For compiled languages, extraction works by monitoring the normal build process."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "The extractor can run either directly on the source code, or during the build process, depending on how it's configured."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The extractor only runs in one way for compiled languages."
  - content: "The final step of CodeQL analysis is:"
    choices:
    - content: "Interpreting the results"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Running CodeQL queries against the database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Running CodeQL queries against the database is the second step of CodeQL analysis."
    - content: "Creating a CodeQL database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Creating a CodeQL database is the first step of CodeQL analysis."
