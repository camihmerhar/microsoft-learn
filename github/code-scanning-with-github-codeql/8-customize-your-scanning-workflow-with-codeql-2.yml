  - content: "Dave's repository contains code in multiple languages, but he would like CodeQL code scanning to only analyze C++ and Python. Which of the following options is a method to do that?"
    choices:
    - content: "List all the languages in the repository in the 'languages' array in the workflow file and exclude elements by prefixing them with '-'."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "By default, CodeQL will only analyze the languages listed in the 'languages' array. There's no need to list languages that you don't want analyzed and then exclude them."
    - content: "List the languages that he wants to exclude in the 'languages-exclude' array in the workflow file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The workflow file doesn't contain a 'languages-exclude' array."
    - content: "List the languages that he wants to analyze in the 'languages' array in the workflow file."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
