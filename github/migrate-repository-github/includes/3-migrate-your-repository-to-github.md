In this exercise, you'll use GitHub Learning Lab to plan and execute the successful migration of a project to GitHub from a legacy version-control provider.

GitHub Learning Lab is an integrated experience that's easy to use. You get feedback and instructions throughout the lab as you work in your GitHub repository.

Here are a few suggestions to make the Learning Lab exercise more enjoyable.

- GitHub Learning Lab is installed on your account in the first step of this lab. If you're asked, be sure to *install it on all repositories*. This won't affect the organizations you're a member of, just the personal repositories the lab creates for you.
- After the install, you may be returned to the main page. To get back to your lab, just use the button on the bottom of this page.
- GitHub will create a repository for you to use. Give permissions to GitHub Learning Lab.
- GitHub Learning Lab will set itself as a reviewer on your pull requests so it can give you the next steps just in time. Sometimes reviewing your pull request will take a few minutes.
- When you're given a link for creating or editing a file or told to open a tab, **be sure to open it in another tab in your browser**. This way, you can come back to the instructions without leaving the file.
- Comments and instructions will continue on your pull request or in an issue on your repository.
